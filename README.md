A Colorado Board of Election employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Summary
With this script and a few modifications we can do an audit on a grander scale (national election) by adding in more candidates to the pool or a more in depth way by finding the results of each candidate in each county of a state. With modifications we can dive deep and see how a particular candidate did in a county like Jefferson County or in a different county of a different state if we expand analysis to a national level.
